 * \brief Abstract receive handler.
 *
 * Receives zero or more bytes blocking if necessary. The interface does _not_
 * poll its receiver. Instead, it typically blocks the caller task until one or
 * more bytes appear.
 *
 * The interface lends itself to reuse for either (1) progressively received
 * octet streams, or (2) for receiving frames of octets as single clipped
 * datagram units. In the first case, the return value counts the currently
 * buffered span of octets, where as the size returned describes the number of
 * frame octets.
